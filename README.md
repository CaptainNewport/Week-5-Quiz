# Week-5-Quiz
This is the code for the Week-5 Assignment This assignment unfortunately didn't quite come out the way I intended. CSS is again minimal as I chased the functionality of the assignment first. The timer works to an extent in the way it will tally the quiz but will not stop the interval function As a result, this means that the entire program continues as the timer stops and quiz is "submitted" You can work through it first and then hit submit and get a better result The timer is set to 5 seconds but BE WARNED- it doesn't stop looping after the timer hits below 0 so recommended to try once and then refresh page.
